# ClipVault

ASP.NET Core MVC web application that allows you to save your favorite videos from across the web in one place.
Each video contains a title, description, thumbnail, tags, and a link to its online source. The project demonstrates full CRUD functionality, Entity Framework integration, and dynamic Razor views.

This is a work in progress application, so there's a lot to be added in the future.
